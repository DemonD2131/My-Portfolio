Note: This tetris game was made using code from the internet. I copied down the tetris.py from the internet and then used that code to further my understanding.
I didn't document who I used the code from but I learned a lot about how classes worked from it.
THE LOGIC IS NOT MY LOGIC this was a practice of syntax basically.
